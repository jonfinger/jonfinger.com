# Changes Beginning... Again

As the sun sets on our *brief* life chapter in California, we're gearing up for some major life changes ⚠️. We've been here for approximately one (1) year now "finding ourselves," but apparently we're still lost because it's time to move on.

I find myself filled with ~~gratitude~~ bemusement 🎰 for the freedom that my career in tech and data science has afforded me. It's a stark contrast to my previous life of *checks notes* ...last year when I praised this exact same freedom while leaving Chicago. Turns out I'm not just unchained from Idaho OR Chicago, but now I'm also untethered from California. I'm basically a digital nomad at this point, except I keep buying furniture 🛋️.

Next stop: Las Vegas 🎲🃏✨. Because when you're searching for mental health stability, nothing says "solid life choices" quite like moving to a city that literally never sleeps and is built on the concept of losing money. The freedom and ability to make this move is not just a logistical win, but a completely predictable pattern at this point 🎪.

Looking back at my blog post from *literally last year*, it's almost surreal to think about how confident I was that California was "the next chapter." Plot twist: it was more like a brief footnote. Turns out I never knew stability was this elusive, and I consider myself incredibly lucky to have such a high tolerance for packing boxes 📦.

So, here's to the next chapter (no really, THIS time for sure), the next adventure, and the statistical probability that I'll be writing this same post from Denver in 2027. Vegas, baby! Let's roll the dice! 🎰🛻💨
