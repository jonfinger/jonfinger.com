## Jon Finger

I am a Python data scientist with a biology foundation, focused on climate and satellite-informed modeling for species movement and ecological risk.

My work spans applied machine learning, remote-sensing feature engineering, and MLOps. I build pipelines, APIs, and model workflows that are measurable, testable, and maintainable in production.
