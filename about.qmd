## Jon Finger

I am a Python data scientist with a biology foundation, focused on building adaptive systems that move from signal to decision with clear operational controls.

My work spans applied machine learning, natural language processing, and MLOps. I design pipelines, APIs, and model workflows that are measurable, testable, and maintainable in production.

If you want to see execution quality, start with the Projects page for shipped systems and reproducible research artifacts.
