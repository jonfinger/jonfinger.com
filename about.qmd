Operating Rules
:::

1. Solve for outcomes, not status.
2. Keep tradeoffs visible.
3. Protect quality while moving quickly.
4. Treat AI as a tool, not a belief system.
:::

I care about outcomes, not theater.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of science, education, and production AI workflows. I like systems that are honest about tradeoffs: speed versus rigor, scale versus trust, novelty versus reliability.

This site is where I share field notes from that work.
