Data scientist. Builder. Recovering academic. I work at the edge where messy real-world constraints meet practical AI execution.

I care about outcomes, not theater.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of science, education, and production AI workflows. I like systems that are honest about tradeoffs: speed versus rigor, scale versus trust, novelty versus reliability.

This site is where I share field notes from that work.
