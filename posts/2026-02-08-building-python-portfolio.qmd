## What matters in a portfolio

I want a portfolio that reads like production work, not a collection of demos. That means:

- Clear problem statements
- Real constraints (data quality, deployment, observability)
- Systems that can be maintained by someone else

## The bar I care about

I optimize for reliability and clarity. If a project has an API, it should be testable, documented, and observable. If it is a pipeline, it should be containerized and repeatable. If it is a model, it should explain its inputs and outputs clearly.

This site is meant to make those priorities obvious at a glance.
